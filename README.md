# water-jug-in-prolog-IDS
This classic AI problem is described in Artificial Intelligence as follows:  “You are given two jugs, 
a 4-gallon one and a 3-gallon one. Neither has any measuring markers on it. 
There is a tap that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly 2 gallons of water into the 4-gallon jug?”.

 iterative deepening search or more specifically iterative deepening depth-first search is a state space/graph search strategy in which 
 a depth-limited version of depth-first search is run repeatedly with increasing depth limits until the goal is found.
 we use this method to reach the goal in this problem.
